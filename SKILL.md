name: peakstate-deck
description: Build an HTML slide deck, review it in the browser, and export it to PowerPoint with editable text. Use when authoring or editing a deck, when delivering a deck the reader is meant to comment on, when a deck comment payload comes back, or when a deck needs a .pptx or a print-ready PDF. Pairs with html-brief, which does the review half for documents.

# peakstate-deck

One tool, three jobs: **author** a deck as a single standalone HTML file, **review** it in
the browser and round-trip the comments, **export** it to native PowerPoint.

A deck is one `index.html` with `deck-stage.js` and `deck-tools.js` beside it. No build step, no server, no
framework. `index.html?audit` reports per-slide overflow; "all N slides clean" is the pass.

| Job | Start here |
|---|---|
| Author or edit a deck | `slides/README.md` — the runtime, the surfaces, the five treatments |
| Scaffold a new deck | `python3 bin/deck init <folder> --theme peak-state` |
| Export to PowerPoint | `python3 slides/export-pptx.py --deck /abs/path/index.html --theme peak-state` |
| Add the review layer | The next section |
| Work a returned payload | `reference/the-payload.md` |

## The review layer

`html-brief` gives a document selection comments and a Copy-responses payload.
This does the same for a **slide deck**: select text on a slide, write a note,
hit Copy, paste the JSON into chat. The payload says which build was reviewed
and where every note belongs, so no other context is needed.

## Install it into a deck


One file, no dependencies, no build step.

    cp <skill>/assets/deck-comments.js <deck-folder>/

Then, in the deck HTML, after the deck script:

    <script src="deck-comments.js"></script>

And in `<head>`, four meta tags — **this is the part that makes the payload
self-sufficient**, so do not skip it:

    <meta name="deck-file"        content="path/to/deck.html">
    <meta name="deck-source"      content="path/to/generator.py">
    <meta name="deck-build"       content="2026-01-01T00:00:00Z">
    <meta name="deck-build-hash"  content="<12 hex chars>">
    <meta name="deck-resolutions" content="path/to/review-resolutions.json">

- `deck-file` — the deck, repo-relative.
- `deck-source` — the file to EDIT. On a generated deck that is the generator,
  never the emitted HTML. Same value as `deck-file` when the deck is hand-written.
- `deck-build` — UTC timestamp of the build.
- `deck-build-hash` — a short content hash of the slides. It is what lets Claude
  notice that the deck moved after the comments were written.
- `deck-resolutions` — where the ticked-off comments live. See below.

A generator should emit all four. In Python:

    import hashlib, datetime
    body = ''.join(slide_html) + ''.join(speaker_notes)
    build_hash = hashlib.sha256(body.encode()).hexdigest()[:12]
    build_at = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')

## Ticking comments off


Across rounds, the expensive mistake is re-reading comments already dealt with.
So Claude ticks them off, and the deck shows it.

Keep a `review-resolutions.json` beside the deck:

```json
{ "resolutions": [
  { "at": "2026-01-01T09:15:22.100Z", "status": "addressed", "build": "84c3ea6ae5e8",
    "note": "Reworded to say what the figures count." },
  { "at": "2026-01-01T09:18:04.900Z", "status": "question",
    "note": "Needs a decision before I can act." }
] }
```

`status` is `addressed`, `wontfix` or `question`. `note` is what to tell the
reader, and it renders under the comment in the list.

The build embeds this file as a JSON block the runtime reads:

    <script type="application/json" id="deck-resolutions"> …the file… </script>

**Entries are keyed by the comment's `at` timestamp, not by an id, and that is
the whole trick.** Editing a comment rewrites its `at`, so the resolution stops
matching and the tick falls off by itself. A comment the user reconsiders comes
back as `new` without anybody having to remember to clear anything.

In the payload every comment then carries `status`, `addressedInBuild` and
`resolutionNote`, and the top level carries `openCount`. In the list, an
addressed comment is dimmed and stamped; its highlight stops being painted; and
the count badge reads `open/total`.

**Work only `new` and `question`.** Do not redo `addressed`, and do not report
on it — the user has read that round already.

## Branding on and off

The reader can hide the branding on every slide: the diamond control in the bar, or **Branding:
on/off** in the overview. It is a view setting, saved with the deck's other review state.

The toggle only puts `deck-nobrand` on `<html>`. **What counts as branding is the deck's own
call**, so a deck opts in by styling it:

    html.deck-nobrand .ft .brand,
    html.deck-nobrand .brandmark { visibility: hidden; }

A deck that never wrote that rule ignores the toggle, which is the right failure: this layer does
not get to guess which marks are yours.

## Companion files

Open one when its line is true of the work in front of you; never preload them.

| File | Read this when |
|---|---|
| `reference/the-payload.md` | A payload has come back and you are working it, or you are changing what one carries |
| `reference/the-overview.md` | You are working on the overview, the bar, or the keyboard |
| `reference/identity.md` | Slides moved or were renamed, or the deck has states |
| `reference/authoring.md` | You are writing or generating the deck itself |
| `reference/internals.md` | You edited `deck-comments.js` and need to know what must still hold |
