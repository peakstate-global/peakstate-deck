# The payload, and what to do with one

## The payload


```json
{
  "kind": "deck-comments",
  "version": 4,
  "instruction": "…what to do with this…",
  "deck": { "title": "…", "file": "…", "source": "…", "build": "…", "buildHash": "…" },
  "slideCount": 20,
  "capturedAt": "…",
  "commentCount": 2,
  "comments": [
    { "n": 1, "slide": 7, "slideId": "the-board", "slideLabel": "The board",
      "target": "selection", "quote": "the exact words selected",
      "comment": "what to change", "at": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Alongside those, and all optional:

| Field | Shape | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `starredSlides` | `[{slide, slideId, slideLabel}]` | Slides flagged for attention. A marker, **not** an edit. |
| `orderChanged` | `true` / `false` | Whether the reader asked for a new order. |
| `slideOrder` | `[{position, wasSlide, slideId, slideLabel}]` | Present only when `orderChanged`. The full order the reader wants. `position` is the new place, `wasSlide` the number in the build they reviewed, `slideId` the address that does not move. |
| `orderInstruction` | string | What to do with `slideOrder`. |
| `starInstruction` | string | What a star means, so a star is never read as an edit. |
| `hiddenSlides` | `[{slide, slideId, slideLabel, inSource}]` | Everything that should end up hidden. |
| `visibilityChanges` | `[{slide, slideId, slideLabel, from, to}]` | Only what now differs from the generator. |
| `noteEdits` | `[{slide, slideId, slideLabel, note, previousNote}]` | Speaker notes the reader rewrote. |
| `orphanedComments` | `[{slideId, slideLabel, target, quote, comment, at}]` | Comments whose slide is gone. Ask, never reassign. |

`target` is `selection` (anchored to `quote`) or `slide` (the whole page).

**`slideId` is how the receiving agent finds the slide, and the number is not.**
Every array above that names a slide carries it, alongside the `slide` number and
the `slideLabel` a human reads. Search `deck.source` for the id: it is the one
thing in the payload that does not move when the deck is renumbered or a heading
is rewritten, which is exactly when a number or a label sends you to the wrong
slide. A deck that grew from 28 to 62 slides in an evening moved every number in
it.

**When `slideId` is absent, the deck predates minted ids.** The key is simply
omitted, never empty and never the label wearing an id's name. Fall back to the
slide number, then check `slideLabel` matches the slide you landed on before you
edit anything, and say so in your reply if it does not. Adding `data-slide-id` to
the generator stops this happening again.

**`slideId` is additive and did NOT bump the version.** It is an extra key on
entries that already existed, so a consumer that ignores it parses a version-3
payload exactly as before, and a deck with no minted ids emits the same payload it
always did. There is nothing to migrate.

**Version 3 adds `starredSlides`, `orderChanged`, `slideOrder`, `orderInstruction`
and `starInstruction`, and nothing else.** Every version-2 field keeps its name and
shape, so a consumer that ignores the new fields still parses a version-3 payload,
and a version-2 payload from an older deck still reads correctly. The bump is a
signal, not a break: a payload that can carry a reorder instruction asks more of
the agent than one that cannot, and the version is how the agent knows to look.

**Version 4 adds `noteEdits`, `hiddenSlides`, `visibilityChanges`, `primaryStates`,
`primaryInstruction` and `unchanged`, and nothing else.** Same rule as the last bump: every
version-3 field keeps its name and shape, so an older consumer still parses a version-4
payload. The runtime emits 4; anything asserting 3 is stale.

The UI rename from "Comment slide" to "Slide comment" touched **no payload key**.
A whole-page comment is still `"target": "slide"`, so saved payloads and existing
`review-resolutions.json` files are untouched.

**`comments[]` carries the OPEN ones only.** Anything already ticked off has been
read, acted on and reported, so copying it back is noise in both directions;
`addressedCount` records how many were left out. `noteEdits[]` sits alongside.

## The payload is a diff, not an inventory


Every array in a copied payload is something the reader **changed**. What they left alone is a
count in `unchanged`, never a row. A slide already hidden in the generator, a primary already
marked there, a note that matches the note in the deck: none of them appear, because an
instruction to make a change that is already made is noise that teaches the reader to skim.

Two consequences worth knowing. A note edit whose text equals the deck's own note is dropped at
copy time, which is what stops slide renumbering from manufacturing phantom edits — the bag is
keyed by slide number, so an edit stored against 7 gets compared with a different slide after a
build inserts one. And the long instruction that used to ride in every payload lives here instead;
the payload carries a short one that names this file.

## Acting on a payload


1. **Locate every slide by `slideId`, not by its number.** Search `deck.source`
   for the id. Use the number and `slideLabel` only when an entry carries no
   `slideId`, and confirm the label matches before you edit.
2. **Check `deck.buildHash` against the current build first.** If it differs the
   deck changed after the review; say so before touching anything, because a
   quote may no longer exist.
3. Edit **`deck.source`**, never the generated HTML. A generated deck overwrites
   hand edits at the next build.
4. **If `orderChanged` is true, apply `slideOrder` last.** Every slide number in
   the payload, in `comments[]`, `hiddenSlides[]`, `visibilityChanges[]`,
   `noteEdits[]` and `starredSlides[]`, is the numbering of the build the reader
   reviewed. Their `slideId` does not move, so work from that wherever it is
   present and the reorder costs you nothing. Resolve all of those first, then
   move the slide-building calls in `deck.source` so the emitted order matches
   `slideOrder`, changing nothing else about those slides. Say in your reply what the new numbering is.
5. **A star is not a task.** `starredSlides[]` says where the reader's attention
   was. Look at those slides first and lead your reply with what you found, but do
   not change one unless a comment asks you to.
6. Rebuild, then re-run the deck's own layout check if it has one.
7. Answer the questions as questions. A comment ending in `?` wants a reply, not
   a silent edit.
8. **Tick off what you did** — write every handled comment into
   `review-resolutions.json` and rebuild, so the next round starts from what is
   still open rather than from all of it.
